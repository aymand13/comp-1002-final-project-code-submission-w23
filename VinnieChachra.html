            <p onclick="changeColor(this)">I am Vinnie Chachra, studying Computer programming at georgian college. I am from India and came here to do my diploma. I was surrounded byloving parents who instilled in me the importance of family, education, and hard work. Growing up, I was surrounded by the beauty of nature, and I developed a deep love for the outdoors. I spent my days exploring the woods, playing with friends, and nurturing my curiosity about the world around me. My parents were my first teachers, and they nurtured my thirst for knowledge, encouraging me to excel in my studies and pursue my passions.Education has always been a priority in my life. I attended [DPS], where I discovered my love for science and technology. I was fascinated by how the world worked, and I spent hours researching about coding and being a programmer.In addition to my academic pursuits, I also had a deep passion for music. I learned to play the guitar at a young age and spent countless hours strumming my favorite tunes. Music became an outlet for me, allowing me to express my emotions and creativity. I also developed a love for photography and spent many weekends capturing the beauty of nature and the world around me through my lens. My hobbies provided me with a sense of joy, inspiration, and a creative outlet during challenging times.</p>

      Volunteer Experience</h5>
      <p>Making a difference in the world and giving back to my community have always been my top priorities. But I didn't figure out how to put that desire into practise until I was in college. I learned about the world of volunteering there. I got things going by participating in the campus employment fair as a sustainability hero and pitching the idea there. Over 500 students and staff members participated in 5 sustainable development activities that were planned and carried out on campus, increasing knowledge of the UN Sustainable Development Goals by 20%. In addition,I received a certificate of participation for actively participating in a college event and exhibiting great organisational, collaborative, and communication skills.
