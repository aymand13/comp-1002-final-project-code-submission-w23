                    My name is Sia Chachra, and I am a first year Computer Programming student at Geogrian College,
                    Brrie,Ontario. I was born and raised in New Delhi, India, where my parents instilled in me a love of hard
                    work and perseverance. My mother is a high school teacher, and she always emphasized the importance of
                    education and learning. My father is a businessman, and he taught me the value of patience and
                    persistence in the face of adversity. Ever since I was a little girl, I've been captivated by the
                    world of dance. Watching ballerinas twirl across the stage or hip-hop dancers busting a move on TV filled
                    me with a sense of wonder and excitement. As I grew older, I began taking dance classes and discovered
                    that dancing was more than just a hobby - it was a way to express myself and connect with others on a
                    deeper level. Throughout my academic career, I always had a passion for technology and computer science.
                    But it wasn't until I took my first coding class that I truly found my calling. Learning to code felt like
                    solving a complex puzzle, and the thrill of finally getting my code to work was unmatched by
                    anything else. As I dove deeper into the world of programming, I discovered that there were endless
                    possibilities for what I could create - from building websites and apps to designing games and software. My
                    passion for coding continued to grow throughout high school, and I knew that I wanted to explore this field
                    further in college. After researching various majors and career paths, I decided to pursue computer
                    programming, as it offered a perfect blend of technical skill and creativity. I am grateful for the
                    support of my family, friends, and mentors, who have played a crucial role in my personal and
                    professional growth. Without their encouragement and guidance, I would not be where I am today. My
                    family has always been my rock, providing unwavering love and support through the ups and downs of
                    life. My friends have been a constant source of laughter and joy, reminding me of the importance of having
                    fun and enjoying the moment. And my mentors, whether they were professors, coaches, or colleagues, have
                    challenged me to reach new heights and inspired me to become a better version of myself. Their
                    advice and guidance have been invaluable, and I am grateful for the many lessons they have taught me along
                    the way.

                    I have always been passionate about giving back to my community and making a positive impact on the
                    world. However, it wasn't until I was in college that I found a way to turn that passion into
                    action. It was there that I discovered the world of volunteering. I started by volunteering as a sustainability hero
                    and introducing the concept at the job fair that took place in the college. Planned and executed 5
                    sustainable development events on campus, engaging over 500 students and faculty members, resulting in a
                    20% increase in awareness of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. I also Attained certificate of
                    participation for actively contributing to a collegiate event, demonstrating strong, collaboration, communication, and
                    organizational abilities. I also managed and ensured the seamless operation of a photo booth at a college event, increasing student engagement by 40%.
