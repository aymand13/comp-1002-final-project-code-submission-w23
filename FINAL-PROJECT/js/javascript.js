  obj.innerHTML = "My name is Sia Chachra, and I am a first year Computer Programming student at Geogrian College, Barrie,Ontario. I was born and raised in New Delhi, India, where my parents instilled in me a love of hard work and perseverance. My mother is a high school teacher, and she always emphasized the importance of education and learning. My father is a businessman, and he taught me the value of patience and persistence in the face of adversity. Ever since I was a little girl, I've been captivated by the world of dance. Watching ballerinas twirl across the stage or hip-hop dancers busting a move on TV filled me with a sense of wonder and excitement. As I grew older, I began taking dance classes and discovered that dancing was more than just a hobby - it was a way to express myself and connect with others on a deeper level. Throughout my academic career, I always had a passion for technology and computer science. But it wasn't until I took my first coding class that I truly found my calling. Learning to code felt like solving a complex puzzle, and the thrill of finally getting my code to work was unmatched by anything else. As I dove deeper into the world of programming, I discovered that there were endless possibilities for what I could create - from building websites and apps to designing games and software. My passion for coding continued to grow throughout high school, and I knew that I wanted to explore this field further in college. After researching various majors and career paths, I decided to pursue computer programming, as it offered a perfect blend of technical skill and creativity. I am grateful for the support of my family, friends, and mentors, who have played a crucial role in my personal and professional growth. Without their encouragement and guidance, I would not be where I am today. My family has always been my rock, providing unwavering love and support through the ups and downs of life. My friends have been a constant source of laughter and joy, reminding me of the importance of having fun and enjoying the moment. And my mentors, whether they were professors, coaches, or colleagues, have challenged me to reach new heights and inspired me to become a better version of myself. Their advice and guidance have been invaluable, and I am grateful for the many lessons they have taught me along the way.";
