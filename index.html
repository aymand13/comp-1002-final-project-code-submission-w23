                    Hello! this is ayman, sia, vinnie and lekhan and this is our group autobiography assignment for our html,java,css class.
                    <br>
                    The reason we all agreed to do autobiography pages was to share more about our selves and share our story and share our plans and ambitions for the future.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    ayman took the part of doing his own biography and doing the about page, lekhan took the part of his biography and the contact page, sia and vinnie took the part of there own biography's and the home page.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We were thankful not to come across many challanges, we had the most trouble linking all the pages together and a race against time as we all had lots going on.
                    <br>
                    we can all take away learning expereince from this project, the biggest lesson is good team communication and attacking our tasks ahead of time.
                </p>
