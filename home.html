                <p>We all remember the first day of our computer programming course at college. It was a daunting
                    experience, stepping into a classroom full of strangers and not knowing what to expect. We were all
                    excited to learn more about programming, but also nervous about the challenging coursework ahead.
                    As the professor began their lecture, we quickly realized that this class was going to be no walk in
                    the park. During a break in the class, we all found ourselves huddled in small groups, trying to
                    process what we had just learned. That's when we noticed each other. A group of us, who would later
                    become friends, were sitting near the front of the room. We noticed that we were all struggling and
                    decided to introduce ourselves. After that initial meeting, we met in other classes and started
                    sitting together in most of the classes . We would work on assignments together and help each other
                    understand the more difficult concepts. As we spent more time together, we became close friends. We
                    all had different backgrounds and interests, but our shared passion for programming brought us
                    together. We would often meet up outside of class to hang out, or work on side projects together.
                    Despite our close bond, the coursework was still challenging. There were times when we all felt
                    overwhelmed and unsure if we were going to be able to keep up with the class. But we persevered, and
                    our study group became a support system that helped us through the tough times. We would often
                    commiserate about the difficulty of the class and share tips on how to tackle the coursework. As the
                    semester came to a close, we all felt a sense of accomplishment. We had made it through a
                    challenging course and had formed lasting friendships in the process. Looking back, we realized that
                    our computer programming course had not only taught us about programming but also about the value of
                    collaboration and teamwork. We had all grown as individuals and programmers, and we knew that our
                    study group would always be a part of our college memories.
